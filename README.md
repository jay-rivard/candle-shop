E-commerce website created as a school project, tested exclusively on Microsoft Edge & created on VS Code.

	*** WEBSITE IS NOT CROSS BROWSER COMPATIBLE - LARGELY INCOMPATIBLE WITH SAFARI, MINOR SIZING ERRORS WITH CHROME ***

The assignment this website was made for was split into 3 parts: HTML/CSS, JAVASCRIPT, PHP/DB. 
Accordingly, I have three versions of the website in different stages of development - the first was not included.

	The 'static' version contains no database connection and runs solely on Javascript.
	An array of JS objects is used to represent the data that would be used. 
	
	The 'full' version contains minimal JavaScript and relies on data from a PHP database connection.
	The website runs & was tested on XAMPP Web Server.
	The connected MySQL database contains a single PRODUCT table (attached below is an image).

The class in which this assignment was given did not teach responsive or accessible website design. Subsequently, the site is not yet responsive but will be updated in the future.
